# HACK(Richo): For some unknown reason, some of the supervisor labels mess
# up the supervisor's robot window. This seems to be a webots bug. The weird
# thing is that some labels (such as the team names, scores, and time) don't
# present any issue (as far as I can tell). So anyway, I made this class as
# a workaround to avoid drawing these messages in the 3D window. Instead,
# I'm making a separate panel in the supervisor window to display these
# messages. I think this is also better because the panel can be scrolled,
# so we don't need to delete old messages.
